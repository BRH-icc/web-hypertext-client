# Reaching Out to CERN About Web Hypertext Client

## Project Context
Our web-hypertext-client project directly addresses many items from the historical CERN WWW bugs/tasks page (https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Bugs.html), implementing:

- Cross-platform desktop clients
- Collaborative hypertext editors 
- "Knowbot" intelligent web crawlers
- Document export capabilities ("text from hypertext")
- Integration of client and server concepts

## Suggested Outreach Message Template

Subject: Modern Implementation of Original WWW Vision - Web Hypertext Client

Dear CERN Team,

I wanted to share an exciting project that directly implements many of the original World Wide Web concepts outlined in your historical WWW bugs/tasks document (https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Bugs.html).

Our "Web Hypertext Client" is a cross-platform desktop application that recreates Tim Berners-Lee's original vision of the web as both a browsing AND editing medium. Key features include:

✅ Cross-platform clients (Windows, macOS, Linux) - addressing your "More clients" need
✅ Collaborative hypertext editor - fulfilling the "Editors only exist on the NeXT" gap
✅ "Knowbot" intelligent web crawler - implementing your proposed "smart algorithms"  
✅ Document export engine - solving the "text from hypertext" book printing need
✅ Integration of browsing and editing - the "client which generates HTML" concept

This project demonstrates how the original collaborative, editable web vision can be realized with modern technology while staying true to the founding principles.

Project details: [Include GitHub/repository link]
Documentation: Available in our README.md

We'd love to share this with the CERN community and contribute to preserving the history and evolution of web technologies.

Best regards,
[Your name]

## Social Media Outreach

### Twitter/X
- **@CERN** - Main CERN account
- **@webfoundation** - World Wide Web Foundation
- **@w3c** - World Wide Web Consortium

### LinkedIn
- Search for CERN employees in web/IT roles
- Post in relevant technology groups

### Academic Channels
- Submit to web history conferences
- Contact computer history museums
- Reach out to Tim Berners-Lee directly via MIT/W3C

## Follow-up Actions
1. Prepare demo materials (screenshots, videos)
2. Create technical documentation highlighting historical connections
3. Consider open-sourcing if not already
4. Prepare presentation materials for potential talks/demos

## Historical Significance
This project represents a "full circle" moment - implementing the collaborative web that was originally envisioned but got lost in the transition to a read-only web. CERN would likely appreciate seeing their original vision realized.
